# MCP-First Development Roadmap

## Core Principle
Every feature must have an MCP interface to enable AI agent interaction.

## Implementation Standards
1. Each MCP tool must have comprehensive error handling
2. All tools require proper authentication/authorization
3. Tools should return structured data suitable for LLM consumption
4. Include usage examples and parameter validation
5. Maintain backward compatibility

## Future Vision
- AI agents can fully manage teams
- Autonomous project staffing
- Intelligent skill matching
- Predictive team optimization
