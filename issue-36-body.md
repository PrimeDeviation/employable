## Overview
Evaluate Fly.io as the hosting platform for dynamically provisioning isolated MCP servers for employable teams.

## Background
The employable system requires dynamic provisioning of isolated MCP servers for each team. Fly.io's Firecracker-based microVMs offer potential advantages:
- **Isolation**: Each team gets its own secure environment
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Performance**: Lightweight VMs with fast startup times
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay-per-use model for team servers

## Research Areas

### 1. Technical Feasibility
- **Firecracker microVMs**: Evaluate isolation and performance characteristics
- **Dynamic provisioning**: API capabilities for creating/destroying VMs
- **Resource limits**: CPU, memory, and storage constraints
- **Networking**: Inter-VM communication and external access patterns
- **Startup time**: Time to provision and start new MCP servers

### 2. Security & Isolation
- **VM isolation**: Security boundaries between team environments
- **Network security**: Firewall rules and access controls
- **Data isolation**: Storage separation between teams
- **Authentication**: Integration with employable's auth system
- **Compliance**: Data residency and regulatory requirements

### 3. Integration Architecture
- **MCP server deployment**: Containerization and deployment strategies
- **Database connectivity**: Connection to Supabase from isolated VMs
- **Service discovery**: How teams find and connect to their MCP servers
- **Load balancing**: Distribution of agent connections across servers
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and observability for team servers

### 4. Cost & Performance Analysis
- **Pricing model**: Cost per VM, bandwidth, and storage
- **Performance benchmarks**: Latency, throughput, and resource usage
- **Scaling patterns**: Auto-scaling based on team activity
- **Resource optimization**: Minimizing costs while maintaining performance
- **Alternative providers**: Comparison with other VM hosting options

## Deliverables
1. **Technical evaluation report** with feasibility assessment
2. **Architecture diagrams** showing integration with employable system
3. **Cost analysis** with projected monthly/yearly expenses
4. **Security review** of isolation and access controls
5. **Implementation plan** for MCP server deployment on Fly.io
6. **Proof of concept** demonstrating basic MCP server provisioning

## Success Criteria
- Fly.io can reliably provision isolated MCP servers
- Security isolation meets employable requirements
- Cost model is sustainable for expected team growth
- Integration with existing employable infrastructure is feasible
- Performance meets agent communication requirements

## Timeline
- Platform research: 1 week
- Technical evaluation: 1-2 weeks
- Security assessment: 1 week
- Cost analysis: 3-5 days
- Proof of concept: 1-2 weeks
- Final recommendation: 1 week
